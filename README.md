# cs67_assignment_2
This is my cs67 assignment 2. The basic idea of the assignment was to find one technology that is foreign to us and try to learn the basics of it from one or two tutorial videos. Then create something new using that technology. The technology I choose was Flutter and I created a small app that allows you to input different colors to change the appearance of the screen.
