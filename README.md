# Color Changing App: My first Flutter project

This is my cs67 assignment 2. The basic idea of the assignment was to find one technology that is foreign to us and try to learn the basics of it from one or two tutorial videos, then create something. The technology I choose was flutter and I created a small app that allows you to input different colors to change the appearance of the screen. The app was made for mobile, but can be run on desktop if desired. However, it will not look as prety.

## Set Up

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

If you do not have flutter installed, you'll want to head here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

This page will guide you through the process of getting flutter up and running on your computer. If you follow the start-up in the documentation you should have everything you need to download my project and start it up.
